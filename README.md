# About
A FumoCam clone (24/7, interactive, in-game Twitch bot) utilizing Rust.

# A note on code quality
Most people start learning languages with a "hello world" program. I skipped a step or hundred and made a Twitch bot that can emulate user input cross-platform to play a video game, as my first program.

I do not know how to print to console in Rust if you were to ask me to do so without googling. Hopefully that addresses any questionable design choices you see in this repository.
