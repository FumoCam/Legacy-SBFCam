# About

A FumoCam clone (24/7, interactive, in-game Twitch bot) utilizing Rust.

Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/sbfcam

# A note on code quality

This was my first Rust project. I did not make a "hello world" or consult any tutorials/guides beyond what I immediately needed.

This version of the bot was built off another bot in another language that was built off patches upon hacky solutions upon more patches.

Architecture, good coding practices, and maintainability was the lowest priority during development.

Usage of Rust was initially for novelty, but a proper redesign is in progress.

# Installing

## Missing files

You will see README.md files in some of the resource folders with "Items not in version control".

- You can find these in the private [Legacy-SBFCam-Other-Resources](https://github.com/FumoCam/Legacy-SBFCam-Other-Resources) repository.
- If you do not have access, you can request it from me.
- Alternatively, you can supply your own versions of the missing files, there is nothing remarkably unique.
