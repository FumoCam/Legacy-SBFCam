# About

A FumoCam clone (24/7, interactive, in-game Twitch bot) utilizing Rust.

Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/sbfcam

# A note on code quality

This was my first Rust project. I did not make a "hello world" or consult any tutorials/guides beyond what I immediately needed.

This version of the bot was built off another bot in another language that was built off patches upon hacky solutions upon more patches.

Architecture, good coding practices, and maintainability was the lowest priority during development.

Usage of Rust was initially for novelty, but a proper redesign is in progress.

# Installing

## Missing files

There are some resources (like the OBS profile) that are in a private repository. They are not required, and more like
assets than anything.

- You can find these in the private [Legacy-SBFCam-PrivateResources](Legacy-SBFCam-PrivateResources) repository.
- If you do not have access, you can raise an issue to request it from me.

## Preamble

Designed for Windows 10, the only "Desktop" mode Roblox supports.

_Linux is possible, but requires emulation and is not officially supported, and may suffer from performance issues._

- Display resolution calibrated for 1280 x 720
- Uncheck the checkbox at `Mouse Properties` -> `Pointer Options` -> `Enhance pointer precision`
